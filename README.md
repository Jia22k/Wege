# Wege
 Utilized Java's GUI framework to create a customizable virtual game board with a versatile card deck, each with its own set of rules. Developed a two-player system with clear turn indicators and comprehensive game rules for an engaging and strategic gameplay experience. WegeCard and WegeButton class not coded by me.
